  description:
    "The contemporary warehouse landscape is undergoing a profound transformation, shaped by shifting consumer expectations, the explosive growth of e-commerce, and an insistent demand for faster, more accurate order fulfilment. Traditional, labour- intensive warehouses have steadily been replaced by smart, automated facilities driven by cutting-edge technologies including robotics, automation systems, advanced data analytics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The global momentum behind warehouse automation is accelerating at a remarkable pace, with industry estimates projecting the market will expand from $29.91 billion in 2025 to $63.36 billion by 2030, achieving a CAGR of 16.2%.",
